# Business Problem
It is desired to develop a machine learning model that can predict customers who will leave the company. It is expected to perform the necessary data analysis and feature engineering steps before developing the model.

# Dataset
Telco customer churn data contains information about a fictitious telecom company that provided home phone and Internet services to 7043 customers in California in the third quarter. It shows which customers left, stayed or signed up for their service.
